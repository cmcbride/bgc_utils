DESCRIPTION:
------------
(fofsv/utils subdirectory)

These are simple utilities to compare different halo catalog outputs and for development 
testing (like checking the size of the header).

bgc_read_utils.c 
    some useful reading utilities that can be used directly.  Kind of like a crude library.

calc_group_stats.c
    takes BGC output and creates ASCII group statistics (like COM position, velocity and velocity 
    dispersion).

compare_grp_with_idbe.c
    compare the grp tipsy array format (from UW FOF) with BGC IDBE output.
    
compare_two_grps.c
    compares two grp files in a line-by-line method so it works on LARGE files.

dump_group_pdata.c
    outputs ASCII dump of particles in a specific halo (group_id).  This is helpful for debugging 
    and if one wants quick access to particle data.

header_test_sizeof.c
    verifies BGC header information is correctly sized on this platform.

read_bgc_idbe.c
    example that reads the BGC IDBE format (hard coded).  Verbosely outputs status to the screen.
    
read_bgc_pdata.c
    reads through a BGC output file to ensure that the size is correct.  Uses header information to 
    check how much to read.  Does nothing with the actual particle data beyond checking that the 
    correct amount exists.  *NOTE* if you want to increase the verbosity of this for debugging, set 
    BGC_VERBOSE = 1;  // around line 29 


USING BGC_UTILS IN C CODE:
-------------------------
A good example of using the functions in bgc_read_utils.c can be seen in: 
    fofsv/utils/calc_group_stats.c

These read utilities aren't a proper library.  They are just a couple quick hack routines
pulled into a separate file.  To use them, I recommend the following:
    1) copy fofsv/binary_output.h  to your source directory
    2) copy fofsv/utils/bgc_read_utils.c to your source directory
    3) add these lines of header (order is important!):

	#include "binary_output.h"
	#include "bgc_read_utils.c"

    4) code (and don't compile as .o files)

If you'd prefer to use a different path for these files, it should work fine.
